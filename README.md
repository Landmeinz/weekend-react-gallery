# Gallery of stuff I like


## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This weekend's project was focused on react and css. I've created a gallery page to share pictures of things that I like. 
You can click on an image to see the description, you can click on the like button to add to count of the others whole also likes the image.
You can even leave a public comment on the site by displaying the message tray to reveal the input fields;

I tried pushing myself by creating the message tray feature to force me to better understand GET / POST routes, components, and props;
